squeekboard 1.43.0
------------------
Released November 2024
* Fixes:
    * Labels and icons on buttons will now keep their proportions when the proportions of layouts change.
* Changes:
    * Layouts will now change their shape to fill empty space on the panel.
      Note: For the "Wide"-shapes of layouts, this is currently limited to about 1.4 times the width.
    * A setting for changing wether or not layouts will change their shape to fit the panel has been added.
    * The "Shift"-modifier can be assigned to buttons now.
    * "Shift"-buttons have been added to the terminal-layouts.
    * New emojis from Unicode 16.0 have been added.
    * Layouts have been made more consistent.

squeekboard 1.42.2
------------------
Released November 2024
* Fixes:
    * Compatibility: Squeekboard should now work better with apps that do not use the text-input-protocol of Wayland and rely on specific keycodes being assigned to specific characters/functions.
    * Documentation: The recommended settings for creating layouts while using Phoc in a nested session, have been updated to work correctly with the changes to the scaling-algorithm.

squeekboard 1.42.1
------------------
Released October 2024
* Fixes:
    * With some apps, in particular apps made with Electron, text-input did not work with some buttons, depending on which layout was used. Text-input should now work normally with those apps.
    * In some situations, modifiers were cleared after pressing another button (for example: when pressing `C`, for `Ctrl + C`), resulting in text-input without the modifiers. The modifiers will remain active in those situations from now on.

squeekboard 1.42.0
------------------
Released September 2024
* New layouts:
    * Belarusian (by)
    * French (fr+bepo) terminal-layout
    * Japanese (jp)
    * Serbian (rs), (rs+latin), (rs+latinunicode)
* Changed layouts:
    * Thai (th):
        * There is less empty space now.
        * Most buttons are wider now.
        * The arrangement of buttons for the `symbols` and `numbers` views, is more consistent with other layouts now.
* Fixes:
    * "Keyboard Settings" in the language-selection-popover will now open the correct panel in GNOME Settings.
    * On some relatively small screens in horizontal orientation, the compact shape was used instead of the wide shape,
      even though the wide shape can fit into the same height. The wide shape will be used on those screens now.
* Changes:
    * The height of the panel will adapt to screens differently.
      In particular, the panel will be 1/3 of the screen's height on most monitors in horizontal orientation,
      and as tall as it can be, while maintaining the aspect-ratio of the wide shape (16:5) without empty space next to it,
      for most monitors in vertical orientation.
    * GSettings for adjusting the height of the panel for the keyboard have been added.
    * The documentation has been improved. In particular, it should now be much easier to learn how to test changes to Squeekboard and layouts.
    * After building a Debian-package for Squeekboard and installing it, `update-alternatives` is now supported.
    * The layout-files now have the English name of the language for which the respective layout is, in a comment at the top of the file.
    * For a few languages which do not have a layout yet, a more appropriate fallback-layout will be chosen.

* Development:
    * Squeekboard's versioning now follows Phosh's versioning (for example: Squeekboard 1.38 was released in time for Phosh 0.38)
    * The build-system has been simplified
    * A single Cargo.toml file is used, instead of assembling it from multiple parts
