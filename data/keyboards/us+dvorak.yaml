# The US QWERTY layout has fewer letters on the third row, and so has
# the shift & backspace keys placed there. In contrast, the US DVORAK
# layout has fewer letters on the first row, which makes it a good
# choice for the shift & backspace keys. That leads to what may be,
# for many people, an unexpected layout in numbers mode: the numerals
# are on the third row (not the first) so that the backspace key
# remains in a consistent location regardless of mode, without
# sacrificing key width. (Once could argue that in numbers mode, the
# numerals should be closer to the enter key.) As with any keyboard
# layout, familiarity comes with repeated use.
