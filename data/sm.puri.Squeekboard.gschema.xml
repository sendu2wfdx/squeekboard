      <description>
        The height of the panel for the layout is multiplied by this value,
        while the screen is in landscape-orientation.
        Changing this is currently mostly useful for custom layouts,
        or to work around scaling-issues, because the layout-aspect-ratio is fixed.
        There is an upper limit of 2/3 of the screen.
        For square screens, the setting for screens in landscape-orientation is used.
