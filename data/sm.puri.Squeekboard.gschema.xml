      <description>
        The height of the panel for the layout is multiplied by this value,
        while the screen is in landscape-orientation.
        Changing this is currently mostly useful for custom layouts,
        or to work around scaling-issues, because the layout-aspect-ratio is fixed.
        There is an upper limit of 2/3 of the screen.
        For square screens, the setting for screens in landscape-orientation is used.

      <description>
        While this setting is active, the proportions of layouts can change,
        to fit the available space on the panel.
        It can be useful to deactivate this while designing layouts.
